<p class="center">By Edna Randolph Worrell.</p>


<p>These songs can be used in all manner of entertainments. The music
is easy, and both music and words are especially catchy. Children like
them. Everybody likes them. Sheet music. <strong>Price 25 cents each. Five
copies, $1.00.</strong></p>

<p><strong>WE HOPE YOU’VE BROUGHT YOUR SMILES ALONG.</strong> A
welcome song that will at once put the audience in a joyous frame of
mind and create a happy impression that will mean half the success of
your entire program. Words, bright and inspiring. Music, catchy.</p>

<p><strong>WE’LL NOW HAVE TO SAY GOOD-BYE.</strong> This beautiful song
has snap and go that will appeal alike to visitors and singers. It is just
the song to send your audience home with happy memories of the occasion.</p>

<p><strong>WE’VE JUST ARRIVED FROM BASHFUL TOWN.</strong> This song
will bring memories to the listeners of their own bashful school days.
Words, unusually clever. Music, decidedly melodious. A capital welcome
song, or it may be sung at any time on the program with assured success.</p>

<p><strong>MY OWN AMERICA, I LOVE THEE.</strong> A song that will bring
a thrill of patriotism to the heart of every one who hears it. The children
and grown-ups just can’t resist the catchy music. It makes a capital
marching song.</p>

<p><strong>COME AND PARTAKE OF OUR WELCOME CAKE.</strong> A merry
welcome song and a jolly one, too. The audience will be immediately
curious about the Welcome Cake, and the children will love to surprise
the listeners with the catchy words. Music, easy and tuneful.</p>

<p><strong>LULLABY LANE.</strong> The music and words blend so beautifully that
people will be humming the appealing strains long after they hear this
charming song. A wonderfully effective closing song, whether sung by
the school or as a solo by a little girl, with a chorus of other little girls
with dolls.</p>

<p><strong>JOLLY PICKANINNIES.</strong> Words by Elizabeth F. Guptill. Music
by Edna R. Worrell. This spicy coon song will bring down the house,
especially if you use the directions for the motions which accompany the
music. The black faces and shining eyes of the pickaninnies will guarantee
a hit. The words are great and the music just right.</p>

<p><strong>THE LITTLE BIRD’S SECRET.</strong> Here is just the song for those
two little folks to sing together. They won’t have to be coaxed to sing
it, especially when they find that the whole school is to whistle the chorus.
This is a decided novelty, and will prove a rare treat to your audience.</p>

<p><strong>A GARDEN ROMANCE.</strong> This is a dainty little song telling of the
romance and wedding of Marigold and Sweet William. It is just the
song for dainty little girls to sing.</p>

<p><strong>COME TO THE NURSERY RHYME GARDEN AND PLAY.</strong>
Here is something different for the little folks to sing. The Nursery
Rhyme Folk are so familiar to children, it will be no trick for them to
remember the words. The music has a most captivating swing.</p>

<h2><a name="costumes" id="costumes"></a>COSTUMES AND PROPERTIES</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Frank</span> and <span class="smcap">Alice</span> wear the usual school clothes of children of their
ages.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg</span>, the tiny Grandmother, has her hair powdered, parted in the
middle, and combed down over her ears. She wears a cap, and
spectacles, from which the lenses have been removed. Her dress is
long, of gray material, with white apron and kerchief, which may be
on wrong side to.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mom</span>, the children’s mother, wears her hair high, her dress long.
This dress is preferably a wrapper or tea-gown worn “hind side before.”
She wears an apron, also, one of the round, tea aprons,
either behind or over one hip. She may have a lace collar, pinned
behind.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dad</span> wears long trousers, with his socks pulled up outside, a swallow
tail coat, and vest, both “hind side before.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ecila</span> wears a very short dress, white, or light colored, with a
sash of some other color, preferably red, tied in front. She may
wear beads, which hang down her back. If her hair is long, part
it, comb each side up to the top, and begin to braid there. Braid
tightly, and loop it, so loops will stand out and up pinning into
place, if necessary. Tie ribbons around base of loops. If her hair
has the Dutch cut, bring the top hair, which is left longer, as far
as possible, and tie a ribbon around it, so that it stands up in the
front, just over the forehead, being the bow. She has short socks.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Knarf</span> wears short trousers&mdash;decidedly short&mdash;with frills at the
bottom of bright color. His blouse may be Russian or sailor, but
must be on “hind side before,” and have collar and cuffs of bright
color. A suit of green and white awning stripe, with bright pink
trimmings, would be very effective. Comb his hair in any peculiar
way that that particular boy’s hair can be coaxed to stay. His
stockings are long, striped around with bright blue.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Derf</span> should have a wig, if at all possible, of long curls. Tie one
or two up on the side, with a blue ribbon. He has short socks, and
knickers of material to match his dress, that end above the knee. The
dress may be a kilted skirt and a sailor or middy blouse of white,
with blue trimmings. A sash, with tassels, passes round his waist,
and knots at one side. The big sailor collar should be in front, instead
of behind.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Teacher</span> wears a cap and gown, like those of graduates,
wrong side to. He may have glasses.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Spankety Man</span> is dressed in a dark red cambric garment,
with tight-fitting waist and trousers, in one. It is buttoned behind,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
with large buttons. This suit has high neck, long, close sleeves, and
trousers that button closely round the ankles. He may wear a
visor cap, with the visor behind, or any hat or cap that can be made
noticeable, when improperly worn. He carries a bag with assorted
“spankers.” These may be two or three switches, a slipper, a hair-brush,
a razor-strop, a fly-killer, an egg-turner, a small fire-shovel,
a shingle, and one or two “spankers” with handles cut from
shingles. He should choose one with which to emphasize his song.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Fairy</span> wears a fluffy, full dress of white, pale pink, or blue,
as desired. It has a full waist, and a very full, short skirt. It may
be of crepe paper, mosquito netting, or of some sheer material. She
should have short wings, which may be made of a square of the
goods, folded into an oblong, and gathered along one side where
two edges meet, then fastened among the folds at the back of the
waist. More gauzy wings may be made of wired gauze or netting.
She should have a silver wand, with a star at the end, and a silver
girdle. Her hair should be flowing, with a silver band around it,
and a star above her forehead. Her stockings may be white, or may
match the dress; the slippers should be white or silver.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gother Moose</span> wears a long red skirt, a long black cape and a tall,
pointed hat of red, with a black band.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Greenies</span>, of whom there may be any number from two to
six, are dressed entirely in green, of course. They wear green
stockings, green pointed shoes, made from cloth, full, short bloomers,
and a long, loose blouse, belted in. They have tall, pointed
caps, at the peak of which is sewed a bell, the peak being bent down,
to hang at one side. Any shade of green will do, but the whole
costume should be in the same shade. If the green stockings are
not easily had, color white ones. Each carries a long green ribbon,
strung with tiny bells.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clanty Sauce</span> should be the tallest,
<a name="thinnest" id="thinnest"></a><ins title="Original has 'thinest'">thinnest</ins>
boy obtainable, dressed
in some striped material, the stripes, running up and down. The
trousers are close-fitting, and reach the ankle. The tunic reaches
a little below the waist, and is belted in, high under the arms. He
wears a tall hat, very tall and small around, covered with the striped
material.</p>


<h3>SETTING.</h3>

<p>There should be an inner curtain which shuts off most of the
stage. At the beginning of Scene I, this curtain is down. If this
inner curtain can have on it any common outdoor scene, so much the
better. The first part of the play is enacted before this inner curtain.
When the curtain rises, which it should do as swiftly and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
silently as possible, it discloses Topsy Turvy Land&mdash;an outdoor
scene. Small trees should be placed at the back. Plant the top
branches&mdash;the ones in the center, firmly in pots or pails of earth,
and have stems and roots upward. Fasten odd-looking fruits upon
the branches, by means of fine wire, so that they “hang upward”
instead of downward. A gate and fence may be in the background,
if desired. These may be made of very light strips of wood, or of
cardboard. Have the gateposts square at the top, with ornamental
balls, or other shapes, at the bottom. From these, to the sides,
fasten two horizontal pieces, one very near the top, the other farther
down. Fasten the pickets to these, pointing downward with a good
space between them and the bottom. A few cardboard birds, like
those the children make and color in the first grade and kindergarten,
should be fastened, so that they seem to be perching on the
under sides of the branches of the trees. A garden bench or two
may be behind the fence, wrong side up. Have one near the front,
on one side, so all the characters need not stand, all the time; but
whenever Frank or Alice sit down, they turn it up properly, while
when the others sit, they turn it back. Let this happen occasionally,
through first scene. For Scene II, both curtains are up, but be careful
to have all the setting where it will be hidden by the inner curtain
when it falls, near the end of the play.</p>

<p>This scene, which is a room in the house occupied by Alice and
Frank, should have a small table, and several chairs, all upside down.
Two or three pictures hang upside down on the walls. There may
be a shelf, with everything topsy turvy. A rug, rolled up, is on the
floor, near one side, and is used as a seat by Marg and Mom. If
there is room, have a tiny stand in one corner&mdash;the kind of stand
that has a lower shelf. This must be wrong side up, and on the
shelf may be topsy turvy ornament, jardiniere, or lamp. Leave room
for Clanty Sauce’s box, near the center. The last part of the play
is enacted with the inner curtain down, as in the first part.</p>

<p>Clanty’s box is large enough to hold a small boy, and all the gifts
enumerated. It should be on casters, so the Greenies can pull it in.
In it is a small boy. He is neither seen nor heard, but he must be
able to pass out the correct presents quickly.</p>

<p>(<em>Enter Alice, angrily, runs across front of stage, clenches fists,
stamps&mdash;in short, has a real temper fit, and ends by throwing herself
down, and screaming noisily. Enter Frank, sulkily. He goes
slowly and sullenly to where Alice is crying, then stops, looking
sullenly down at her.</em>)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
<span class="smcap">Frank</span>&mdash;What’s the matter, Alice?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alice</span>&mdash;I’m mad.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frank</span>&mdash;So I see. What about?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alice</span>&mdash;(<em>looking up</em>) What are you mad about, yourself? You
look like a thunder cloud.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frank</span>&mdash;I’m not mad.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alice</span>&mdash;Yes, you are, too. I know. (<em>gets up</em>) What is the matter,
truly?</p>

<p><a name="Frank" id="Frank"></a><ins title="Original omits dash"><span class="smcap">Frank</span>&mdash;(<em>crossly</em>)</ins>
Nothing, I tell you. What were you screeching
so for?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alice</span>&mdash;’Cause I was mad, I tell you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frank</span>&mdash;What for?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alice</span>&mdash;Say, I’ll tell you what I was mad at, if you will, too.
Will you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frank</span>&mdash;<em>Perhaps</em>&mdash;well, yes, I suppose I could. You first, though.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alice</span>&mdash;No, you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frank</span>&mdash;Ladies first, always.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alice</span>&mdash;There, that’s it, exactly. That “always.” Why should a
thing always be just the same? You must always say “ladies first,”
and both of us must offer each other the biggest piece, when we want
it ourselves, and always mind what the grown-ups say, and shut
the door, and a whole lot of nonsense. Why
<a name="shouldnt" id="shouldnt"></a><ins title="Original has 'Shouldn’t'">shouldn’t</ins>
the grown-ups mind us part of the time?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frank</span>&mdash;Is that what you are mad at?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alice</span>&mdash;Yes, it is. My mother thinks I ought to mind everything
she says, and never talk back, and when I said I was going over to
Kitty’s she said I couldn’t, and when I&mdash;argued a little about it, she
said I was saucy, and spanked me. I wish I could find a place where
mothers had to mind their children a while, and see how they like it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frank</span>&mdash;So do I. My teacher kept me after school because I
couldn’t answer every question in my geography lesson. Why
don’t she answer some of them? We scholars have to do all the
work, and the teacher just listens and watches for something to find
fault with, all the time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alice</span>&mdash;I know. Why don’t they let us ask the questions? It
would be much the best way, I’m sure. And rules. I’m so sick of
rules. You mustn’t do this and you mustn’t do that, and if you do,
some one will punish you. I’d like to live where there weren’t any
rules at all, and where children were the biggest for a spell.
Wouldn’t I teach them a thing or two?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frank</span>&mdash;There isn’t any such place, I’m afraid. I never learned
about it in my geography.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
<span class="smcap">Alice</span>&mdash;You’ve never been way through it yet. Perhaps there is,
now. Let’s hunt for it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frank</span>&mdash;All right, let’s. (<em>They sit down on floor, and open geography,
turning the leaves slowly.</em>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alice</span>&mdash;Oh dear. I can’t read half fast enough. It would take
most a year to read all that, and two more years to study all the
maps. Let’s go ask one of the High School boys or girls. They’ve
learned it all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frank</span>&mdash;No, let’s don’t. They’d only laugh at us. The big ones
always do. Let’s go look for it ourselves. We’ll have adventures
on the way, most likely, and it will be great sport.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alice</span>&mdash;All right, let’s. Shall we start now?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frank</span>&mdash;Sure. Shall I go this way and you that, like Red Riding
Hood and the wolf, or shall we go together?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alice</span>&mdash;Oh, together. I’d be afraid to go alone, I’m sure. Hark!
What was that? (<em>A little tinkle is heard.</em>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frank</span>&mdash;Sounded like a very little bit of a bell.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alice</span>&mdash;Listen, and see if it comes again. (<em>The tinkle grows
louder, and the fairy trips lightly on stage.</em>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alice and Frank Together</span>&mdash;Oh!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fairy</span>&mdash;I’m the Fairy Tinkle Bell, of Everywhere. I heard two
little children wishing for a new land, and I’ve come to show them
the way.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alice</span>&mdash;Oh goody, goody. Won’t I have to mind there?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fairy</span>&mdash;No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frank</span>&mdash;And are things different than they are here?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fairy</span>&mdash;Yes, indeed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alice</span>&mdash;Then we’ll go. Take us now, good Fairy, do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frank</span>&mdash;How far is it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fairy</span>&mdash;So far that you never could find the way alone, but I can
take you there in one moment. You have only to do as I say.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Both Children</span>&mdash;Oh, we will, we will.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fairy</span>&mdash;Then take hold of hands, close your eyes, and go round
three times, saying “Topsy Turvy” three times, slowly. Then say
“Here we are” and open your eyes. That is all.</p>

<p>(<em>Children do so. Fairy waves wand, and curtain rises as she
flits out. Children open eyes.</em>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frank</span>&mdash;(<em>who is facing audience</em>) What next? Why, where is
she?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alice</span>&mdash;Why, why, everything is different. It’s not the same place
at all. Where are we?</p>

<p>(<em>Knarf and Ecila run in.</em>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Knarf</span>&mdash;You’re in Topsy Turvy land, of course.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
<span class="smcap">Ecila</span>&mdash;Isn’t that where you wanted to be?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Derf</span>&mdash;(<em>running in</em>) ’Cause you’re here, whether you want to be
or not.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frank</span>&mdash;So I see. Well, perhaps it is where we wanted to be.
At any rate, Fairy Tinkle Bell brought us here, when we were trying
to find a place in the geography.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ecila</span>&mdash;I never heard of that place.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frank</span>&mdash;I never named any place. How do you know you never
heard of it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ecila</span>&mdash;Why, yes you did, too. You told the country you were
journeying in, to find some town. I heard you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frank</span>&mdash;I did not.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Knarf</span>&mdash;Yes, you did. You said you were looking there for this
place you wanted.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alice</span>&mdash;Oh, in the geography. A geography isn’t a place. It’s a
book about places.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Derf</span>&mdash;What’s a book?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frank</span>&mdash;A book? Gee! Don’t you have books here?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ecila</span>&mdash;His name isn’t Gee. It’s Derf.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alice</span>&mdash;That’s a queer name. What’s yours?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ecila</span>&mdash;It’s Ecila. What’s yours?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alice</span>&mdash;Mine is Alice. And what’s his name? (<em>looks toward
Knarf.</em>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ecila</span>&mdash;It’s Knarf.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frank</span>&mdash;Oh, Frank. Same as mine.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Knarf</span>&mdash;No, not same as yours. It’s not Frank at all. It’s Knarf.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frank</span>&mdash;How do you spell it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Knarf</span>&mdash;Spell it? I don’t know what you mean.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frank</span>&mdash;Well, write it. Here. (<em>Takes small pad of paper and
pencil from pocket.</em>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Knarf</span>&mdash;(<em>taking them</em>) What are they for.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frank</span>&mdash;To write with, of course. This way. (<em>Takes them, and
writes.</em>) See. F&mdash;R&mdash;A&mdash;N&mdash;K. That’s Frank. That’s my name.
Write yours.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Knarf</span>&mdash;I can’t. I never heard of such a thing. Is Frank the
name of that thing now? And haven’t you any name left, at all?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frank</span>&mdash;Well, of all the silly questions. Of course it’s my name
just the same. The name of that thing is paper. And if I spell it
backward, it’s Knarf, just like yours. I’ve done it for fun, lots of
times.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ecila</span>&mdash;(<em>to Alice</em>) Can you separate yourself from your name,
that way?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alice</span>&mdash;Can I write it, you mean? Why, yes. (<em>does so.</em>)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
See! A&mdash;L&mdash;I&mdash;C&mdash;E, spells Alice.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ecila</span>&mdash;Could you do mine?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alice</span>&mdash;Why, I guess so. Say it again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ecila</span>&mdash;It’s Ecila.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alice</span>&mdash;It ought to be E&mdash;S&mdash;I&mdash;L&mdash;A. Why, if I spell it with
a C instead of an S, it will be Alice backward. Guess this is Topsy
Turvy Land all right. What’s your name? (<em>to Derf.</em>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ecila</span>&mdash;It’s Derf. Do his on the white thing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alice</span>&mdash;(<em>writing</em>) D&mdash;E&mdash;R&mdash;F. Why, that’s Fred, backward.
That’s my little brother’s name.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ecila</span>&mdash;Yes, and that’s my little brother.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frank</span>&mdash;Little brother! He’s a heap bigger than you are.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Knarf</span>&mdash;No such thing. It will be a long time before he grows
to my size. He’s only three.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frank</span>&mdash;Three. Three what, I wonder? He’s taller than my
father.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ecila</span>&mdash;<a name="Your" id="Your"></a><ins title="Original

you? I’m ten.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alice</span>&mdash;Why, so am I, but I’m not nearly so tall. And Frank is
twelve.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ecila</span>&mdash;So is Knarf. But he’s bigger than I am, and your brother
is smaller than you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frank</span>&mdash;Well, either I’m dippy, or you are. You say everything
topsy turvy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Knarf</span>&mdash;Of course. This is Topsy Turvy Land. How big is your
little brother? As small as Derf?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frank</span>&mdash;He’s three, and about so tall. (<em>measures.</em>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ecila</span>&mdash;So when you say small, or little, you mean big. And your
father? He’s not as little as Derf, you say. How little is he?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Derf</span>&mdash;My Daddy’s big, real big. Big as

<p><span class="smcap">Alice</span>&mdash;He must be tiny. I’d like to see him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Knarf</span>&mdash;I’ll call him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alice</span>&mdash;Maybe he’s busy, or perhaps he wouldn’t like to be called
just to be looked at.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Knarf</span>&mdash;Well, when my own father can’t come when he’s called, or
don’t want to be shown off to my friends, I’ll see about it. (<em>calls

<p><span class="smcap">Alice</span>&mdash;Why, we say that, sometimes. Oh, I see, it’s the same both

<p><span class="smcap">Ecila</span>&mdash;Where’s Mom?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mom</span>&mdash;What is it? Oh! (<em>drops courtesy.</em>) Happy to see you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ecila</span>&mdash;You see, I have her well trained. Does your mother mind
as quick?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alice</span>&mdash;My mother? I have to mind her; she doesn’t mind me.
But is she really your mother?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ecila</span>&mdash;Of course. She wouldn’t mind anyone else as quick, would
she? (<em>Mom goes to Dad, who still looks down, sullenly.</em>)</p>

yet. (<em>to Mom</em>) Come, sing! Sing up, now, at once. There’s a lot

<p>(<em>Mom sings between sobs, “Loora-laddy, loora-laddy” over and

<p><span class="smcap">Dad</span>&mdash;Of course. You think I mind ’cause I like it, do you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alice</span>&mdash;A Marg. What’s that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ecila</span>&mdash;Why, my Marg was Dad’s mother. Some children have
two. Have you any?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alice</span>&mdash;Oh, I see! A grandmother! We do call ours Gram. She
likes it. You don’t make her mind, do you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ecila</span>&mdash;Of course. (<em>calls.</em>) Marg! Marg! Where in Topsy

<p><span class="smcap">Knarf</span>&mdash;Don’t you like to? Then what makes you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frank</span>&mdash;He does. No. I don’t always like to, but I like it better
than I should treating him that way.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Knarf</span>&mdash;How funny. (<em>Derf comes in, pulling Marg behind him.
She holds back and struggles, but he pulls her along.</em>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Derf</span>&mdash;Her was a playin’ blocks, and her wouldn’t come. Her’s a
naughty, naughty Marg. Two, fee, for Fiday.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ecila</span>&mdash;Naughty Marg! She must come when Ecila calls her.
Come here. (<em>Marg hangs back, and Ecila picks her up, shakes her a
bit, then puts her down. Marg sinks down in a heap, crying loudly.</em>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Derf</span>&mdash;Dere’ll be a lot of fees for Fiday, if her don’t stop ’at noise.</p>

<p>(<em>Marg cries harder. Knarf sidles up, and surreptitiously passes
her a piece of candy. She stops crying at once. Ecila spies candy.</em>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ecila</span>&mdash;Now Knarf, you shouldn’t spoil her that way! (<em>to Marg</em>)
Only good Margs ought to have candy. Naughty Margs don’t deserve
any.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg</span>&mdash;I’d give you some, Girl, but it’s all gone. Are you cross
to your Marg? Do you always make her mind quick?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frank</span>&mdash;Of course not. Our dear Gram does as she pleases, and
we all try to please her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg</span>&mdash;Why, how nice! Is she as tall as I am?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ecila</span>&mdash;She’s as tall as Knarf.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg</span>&mdash;And a Marg! How very strange!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Knarf</span>&mdash;Don’t talk so much, Marg. Grown-ups should be seen
and not heard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
<span class="smcap">Derf</span>&mdash;It’s Fiday, it’s Fiday. Here comes the Spankety Man!
(<em>Dad and Mom look wildly around. Marg hides behind Alice.</em>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frank</span>&mdash;It isn’t Friday, either. It’s Wednesday.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Derf</span>&mdash;’Tis Fiday. Spankety Man’s a-coming.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alice</span>&mdash;But it was Wednesday a few minutes ago, and we haven’t
been to bed yet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ecila</span>&mdash;What’s that got to do with it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alice</span>&mdash;Why, it’s got to be night before it’s another day, hasn’t it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ecila</span>&mdash;Not in Topsy Turvy Land. What a strange country you
must live in! Here we jumble our days up more. We don’t go by
rules; we hate them. We have a lot of days together, and then, when
we get sleepy enough, we have a few nights.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frank</span>&mdash;But Thursday has to come before Friday, doesn’t it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Knarf</span>&mdash;Why should it have to? Things don’t go by rule here.
And it is Friday, for here comes the Spankety Man.</p>

<p>(<em>Spankety Man enters, sets down bag, and takes out an assortment
of spankers, which he lays out on the floor.</em>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Spankety Man</span>&mdash;(<em>to Frank</em>) Good Friday, Sir. I believe we
haven’t met before. Any parents or grand-parents?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frank</span>&mdash;Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Spankety Man</span>&mdash;Spanking done every Friday. One spank for
each point. Settlement every New Year’s Day, at so much a hundred.
Discount for specially naughty ones. Want to open an account?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frank</span>&mdash;No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alice</span>&mdash;We wouldn’t want Papa and Mamma spanked; nor Gram,
either. The idea!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Spankety Man</span>&mdash;You’ll spoil’em, Ma’am, spoil’em. Better patronize
me. It’s necessary, I assure you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alice</span>&mdash;No, indeed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Derf</span>&mdash;Tum, sing your song, and get to work. Marg’s awful bad.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Spankety Man</span> (<em>sings</em>) Tune: “Michael Roy.” (<em>He beats time,

<p><span class="smcap">Alice</span>&mdash;Why, everyone knows the United States, all over the earth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Spankety Man</span>&mdash;Did you come from the earth?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frank</span>&mdash;Of course. Did you think we came from Mars?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Teacher</span>&mdash;No, for this is Mars. But it isn’t fair to ask me questions
about the Earth. All our most learned men have been able
to discover about the earth is that it is a very slow-moving, dull
star which turns on itself once every month or two, and takes about
a century to get around the sun. The winters are so long and cold
that no life is possible. It is supposed to be a worn out planet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frank</span>&mdash;The idea! It’s every bit wrong.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ecila</span>&mdash;Keep points, Mr. Spankety Man. (<em>to Teacher</em>) How did
they get here?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Teacher</span>&mdash;I don’t know.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
<span class="smcap">Derf</span>&mdash;Him don’t know. Dat’s five points, or fee, which is it?
It’s my turn. What’s the biggest nanimal in Topsy Turvy Land?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Teacher</span>&mdash;The Wincheopactylus. He is very large and fierce,
and lives on new inhabitants, whom he eats raw. His voice is a
high trill, and he gives warning of his presence&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Knarf</span>&mdash;He certainly does. There’s one coming now. Run,
everybody, run!</p>

<p>(<em>All run out, in confusion, with screams and cries, dragging Frank
and Alice with them. If a tiny dog, or large cat, can be made to
walk across the stage after them, it will add to the climax of the
scene.</em>)</p>

<p>(<em>Room in home of Frank and Alice in Topsy Turvy Land</em>,)</p>

<p>(<em>Enter Frank and Alice.</em>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alice</span>&mdash;There! Just look at this room! I pick up and pick up,
and the minute I go out, when I come back it’s all to do over again.
I never was so sick of anything in all my life, as I am of this
Topsy Turvy Land!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frank</span>&mdash;(<em>placing chair correctly, and sitting down</em>) I wish I could
get hold of that Fairy for a few minutes, that’s what!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alice</span>&mdash;(<em>also sitting down</em>) What could you do with a fairy, I’d
like to know? She’d do something to you before you could say
“Jack Robinson.” (<em>She looks up, crossly, as Knarf enters and seats
himself on a chair, just as it is.</em>) I do wish, Knarf, you’d learn to
knock!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Knarf</span>&mdash;And I do wish, Alice, that you’d remember that our
music teacher has told us over and over, never to knock, even if
you do request it, since it is a bad breach of good manners to do so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ecila</span>&mdash;(<em>entering and seating herself</em>) Don’t you like company,
really, Alice?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alice</span>&mdash;Why, I like you, Ecila, as well, or better, than anything
else in this awful place. But&mdash;(<em>begins to cry</em>) Oh, I’m so homesick,
and so tired of everything being topsy turvy! If I could go
home, I’d never complain about minding again, or rules, either!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Knarf</span>&mdash;Well, of course it is too bad that you haven’t any grown-ups
to make mind.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alice</span>&mdash;I don’t want to make anyone mind. I want my own dear
mother and father and grandma, too. I’d be glad to mind them,
if I could only get a chance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
<span class="smcap">Ecila</span>&mdash;If you could only find the Fairy who brought you here&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frank</span>&mdash;Well, we can’t. We’ve hunted and hunted, but we never
seem to get anywhere when we start out.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Knarf</span>&mdash;Of course not. All roads lead to nowhere in Topsy
Turvy Land. Did yours lead somewhere?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frank</span>&mdash;Of course they did. And our teachers knew something.
They made you study and learn your lessons, instead of calling you
a hopeless little blockhead because you didn’t ask them a lot of
foolish questions about nothing in particular.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alice</span>&mdash;And that music teacher is just the limit. Manners, indeed!
The things he calls manners are the most impolite things
imaginable. And dancing! To walk slowly here and there, and sit
down every so many steps isn’t dancing!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Knarf</span>&mdash;What is it, then?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frank</span>&mdash;Tomfoolery. And what he calls whistling is nothing
more than buzzing! Music teacher! He
<a name="doesnt1" id="doesnt1"></a><ins title="Original has 'dosen’t'">doesn’t</ins>
teach a bit of music!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Knarf</span>&mdash;Why, manners and dancing and whistling are music.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alice</span>&mdash;They are not! The only thing the least bit like music
that I’ve heard since I came here is that measly little song the
Spankety Man sings every Friday.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ecila</span>&mdash;That isn’t music! That queer noise he makes! And all
the Moms know loora-laddy. I should think you’d call that music.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alice</span>&mdash;Well, I don’t. And I don’t even know what time of year it
is. Your days and nights are so mixed up that one can’t keep track
of them at all. We shan’t even know when the Christmas holidays
come.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Knarf</span>&mdash;Yes, you will, for they’re here now, just as soon as
Gother Moose gets here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Derf</span>&mdash;(<em>entering and seating himself in the overturned table</em>)
Gother Moose is

<p><span class="smcap">Ecila</span>&mdash;Why shouldn’t she be?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alice</span>&mdash;Why, our Mother Goose is just a book of rhymes and
jingles&mdash;sort of stories, you know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Derf</span>&mdash;Dat’s what Gother Moose does&mdash;tells stories. Here her
comes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gother Moose</span>&mdash;(<em>entering</em>) Well, well, whom have we here?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Derf</span>&mdash;Erf chilluns.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gother Moose</span>&mdash;Earth children! I’m afraid they belong under
the jurisdiction of my sin twister, who tells her stories in a queer,
jerky sort of fashion. Call in the others, and I’ll be about my task,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
for I must journey on to make the Christmas holidays begin in
the other places. I’m late, as it is. (<em>Dad, Mom, and Marg run in,
and seat themselves, all using the furniture as it is. Gother Moose
remains standing.</em>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gother Moose</span>&mdash;What shall I tell you this time?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Derf</span>&mdash;Hackey Jorner.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gother Moose</span>&mdash;Hackey Jorner was a very little boy, no bigger
than Derf. One time he sat down in the middle of the room, where
the sides came together, and put his foot into the oven, which was
very cold. He pulled out a very small pie, all piping hot, and held
it neatly on his knuckles. Then with his fingers on the other
hand, he began to eat it. He took a bite, then he took another,
then he took another, then he took another, then he took another,
then he took another, then he took another, then he took another,
then&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frank</span>&mdash;Oh, go on! Never mind so many bites.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gother Moose</span>&mdash;But he has only had eight bites. That would be
too large a pie, and this was a small one. So he took another bite,
and then he took another, and then he took another, and then he
took another, and then he took another, and then he took another,
and then he took another, and then he took another, and then he
took another, and then he took another, and then he took another,
and then he took another, and then&mdash;what do you think?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frank</span>&mdash;Oh, he took another, probably.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alice</span>&mdash;No, he found a plum.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gother Moose</span>&mdash;A plum? What a queer word! No he found
no plum, he found&mdash;that he couldn’t take another, because his pie
was gone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Derf</span>&mdash;Tell anodder. Dat was a fine one. Wasn’t it, Alice?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frank</span>&mdash;Very nice indeed&mdash;quite all of a sameness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gother Moose</span>&mdash;Ecila may choose this time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ecila</span>&mdash;Little Po Beeb.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gother Moose</span>&mdash;Little Po Beeb had one, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, woolly cats. One night
Po Beeb did not go to sleep at all, but sat up watching her woolly
cats, and as she watched, they trotted off, down the hill to the
very top, then out of sight, and&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alice</span>&mdash;She couldn’t tell where to find them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gother Moose</span>&mdash;Certainly she could. They were just under the
top of the hill, behind a very small tree. Po Beeb and the Spankety
Man walked after them, and they all came right back. They had
gone for a drink of water.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alice</span>&mdash;So they all came home, wagging their tails behind them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
<span class="smcap">Gother Moose</span>&mdash;Certainly not. They did not come home, they
went home, and they had no tails at all. Cats never have any tails.
And no animal in Topsy-Turvy Land, except the terrible Wincheopactylus,
ever wears its tail behind it. It always dangles gracefully
forward over the left shoulder. But I must hurry on, to tell the
Christmas stories to other Topsy Turvy children. Badgye. Watch
for Clanty Sauce.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Knarf and Ecila</span>&mdash;We will.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Derf</span>&mdash;Yes, us will.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alice</span>&mdash;Clanty Sauce! Oh, Frank, perhaps he’s our own dear
Santa Claus, and will take us home.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frank</span>&mdash;You can’t catch Santa Claus. Haven’t we tried, lots of
times and did we catch even a glimpse of him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ecila</span>&mdash;What a shame! So you never got any presents?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frank</span>&mdash;No, Marg may have mine. She’s little.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Knarf</span>&mdash;I should think she was!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ecila</span>&mdash;Try the orange. Perhaps you’ll like that better.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alice</span>&mdash;(<em>suspiciously regarding hers</em>) Is that sweet, too?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ecila</span>&mdash;No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frank</span>&mdash;Is it sour?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ecila</span>&mdash;Why, no. It’s&mdash;just orangy tasting.</p>

<p>(<em>The children taste theirs, gingerly, then Frank throws his, and
Derf scrambles to get it.</em>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frank</span>&mdash;(<em>indignantly</em>) Do you call pepper orangy tasting?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Knarf</span>&mdash;Aren’t they like yours?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alice</span>&mdash;Why, no. They’re hot with pepper.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ecila</span>&mdash;I don’t know what pepper is, but oranges here always
taste like that. They’re good, I think.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alice</span>&mdash;Then you may have mine (<em>passes it.</em>) Oh, Frank, don’t
swing her by one leg, like that!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frank</span>&mdash;(<em>holding doll out and looking at it.</em>) Well, what do I
want of the thing? And if we can’t swap&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alice</span>&mdash;We can play with each other’s things. (<em>holds out hand
for doll.</em>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ecila</span>&mdash;(<em>catching her hand back</em>) You
<a name="mustnt" id="mustnt"></a><ins title="Original has 'musn’t'">mustn’t</ins>.
No one can touch
another’s Christmas presents. If they do, they’ll get caught by the
Wincheopactylus, and eaten for his Christmas dinner.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frank</span>&mdash;Well, of all the mean
<a name="Christmases" id="Christmases"></a><ins title="Original has
'Christmasses'">Christmases</ins>! That gun and engine
are dandy, if only I had ’em, though! (<em>Looks at Knarf, who
is counting over his stones.</em>) What are those good for?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Knarf</span>&mdash;Why, they’re kites.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frank</span>&mdash;Kites. We call ’em rocks, or stones. You can’t fly
them, I know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Knarf</span>&mdash;Oh yes, I can. You know that tall place you called a
well? They’ll fly clear to the top of that, if I drop ’em.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frank</span>&mdash;(<em>indignantly, looking at Dad</em>) And see that one skate!
Where’s the mate to it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dad</span>&mdash;It doesn’t need a mate. You only skate on one foot at a
time, you know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frank</span>&mdash;I should think you’d look pretty, balancing on one
skate on the ice.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">All</span>&mdash;Why, we don’t skate on <em>ice!</em></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
<span class="smcap">Alice</span>&mdash;(<em>beginning to cry</em>) Oh, I want to go home. I want to go
home! It’s a dreadful Christmas! Oh, I’d be so good if I could
only go home!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frank</span>&mdash;So would I. No more grumbling for this young chap.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fairy</span>&mdash;(<em>dancing in</em>) So you’ve come to your senses?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frank</span>&mdash;Yes, indeed we have, dear Fairy. If you’ll only take us
home, we’ll mind our teachers and parents, and be willing to keep
rules, and learn lessons.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fairy</span>&mdash;You will? And you, Alice?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alice</span>&mdash;Oh, take us home, dear Fairy, do! I’ll be so good, if you
will.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fairy</span>&mdash;And you’ll remember the lessons you’ve learned?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Both</span>&mdash;We will. We couldn’t help it. (<em>Fairy has flitted to
front. They have followed, leaving all the others where curtain
will hide them when it falls.</em>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fairy</span>&mdash;Then close your eyes, take hold of hands, and turn around
three times, saying, “Home again, home again, never to return
again,” then open your eyes, and you’ll see what you’ll see.</p>

<p>(<em>As they do so, inner curtain falls, and she flits out. As they
open their eyes, she calls back, “Remember.”</em>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alice</span>&mdash;Oh we are, we are, back again! There’s the schoolhouse!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frank</span>&mdash;And I’m glad to see it. Think of that! What a dreadful
place Topsy Turvy Land was!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alice</span>&mdash;I’m sure we’ll remember our promise. Only think if we
had to go back again!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frank</span>&mdash;There’s just one thing I wish I’d seen&mdash;that awful wild
beast of theirs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alice</span>&mdash;It might have eaten you up. I’m glad we didn’t see it.
No more Topsy Turvy things for me. I think it was all dreadful.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frank</span>&mdash;And the worst of all was that Topsy Turvy Christmas!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alice</span>&mdash;Let’s run home and find out if Christmas has really come
here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frank</span>&mdash;Let’s hope it hasn’t.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Both</span>&mdash;But no Christmas at all would be better than a Topsy
Turvy Christmas! (<em>Both run out, hand in hand.</em>)</p>

<p class="center p140">Christmas Entertainments</p>

<p><strong>CHRISTMAS AT PUNKIN HOLLER.</strong> A new Christmas play by Elizabeth
F. Guptill that abounds in clean, wholesome fun from beginning to end.
It depicts the trials of the teacher of an old-fashioned “deestric school” in
conducting the last rehearsal for the Christmas Entertainment. Some of the
pupils are in “custom,” as big Jake puts it, and “Sandy Claus” is there. The
children go through their parts with gusto and more or less success. May be
given in any schoolroom by any number. Easy to produce. Costumes simple.
Children and grown-ups will be delighted with CHRISTMAS AT PUNKIN
HOLLER. Price, 15 cents.</p>

<p><strong>A TOPSY TURVY CHRISTMAS.</strong> Another new Christmas play by
Elizabeth F. Guptill. It is decidedly humorous from start to finish. The
characters are strong and at every turn of the play there is a happy surprise
for the audience. The children are tired of “minding,” and
<a name="everything" id="everything"></a><ins title="Original has 'the everything'">everything</ins>
being
“just so,” so they start to find a place where they will find things different.
They find it in Topsy Turvy Land, where they have strange experiences.
When at last they have a Topsy Turvy Christmas, they are ready to go home
and be satisfied with things just as they are. May be given in any school-room
by any number of children not less than fifteen. In two short scenes.
This clever play will prove a sure winner wherever produced. Price, 15 cents.</p>

<p><strong>CHRISTMAS AT McCARTHY’S.</strong> Elizabeth F. Guptill. Here is a new
Christmas play for the older children and as many young children as are
available. It combines in a marked degree the gentlest pathos and the most
sparkling humor. Several nationalities are represented in the tenement and
there is opportunity for the introduction of specialties if desired. Circumstances
cause Elsie, the tenement orphan, to believe Jimmy, the newsboy, will
buy her a Christmas present, and it seems it is up to Jimmy to do it. Christmas
is an unknown quantity at the tenement, but all agree that Elsie must not
be disappointed, and plan to have one somehow. The entertainment is given
by the “inhabitints thimsilves,” at McCarthy’s. In the midst of the fun,
Elsie’s lost father walks in, and the finale is a general rejoicing. Price, 25c.</p>

<p><strong>CHRISTMAS DIALOGUES.</strong> By Cecil J. Richmond. A book full of the
choicest new and original dialogues for Christmas, parts for both boys and
girls being well provided for. Some are for the little folks, in rhyme; some
are for intermediate grades, and others for older children. Every dialogue in
this book is decidedly to the point and easy to prepare. They will delight
young and old alike. Contents: Is There a Santa Claus? 2 small children,
Santa Claus and chorus; Herbert’s Discovery, 2 boys; The Christmas Dinner,
2 little girls, 1 larger girl and 2 boys; Playing Santa Claus, 1 small and 2
larger boys; A Double Christmas Gift, 2 small girls, 2 larger girls, and 3
boys. Price, 15 cents.</p>

<p><strong>EVERGREEN AND HOLLY&mdash;SONG AND DRILL.</strong> By Elizabeth F.
Guptill. A drill for any even number of boys and girls, or all girls. The
girls carry garlands of evergreen while the boys carry wreaths of the same.
After a spectacular drill and fancy march they all sing a beautiful
<a name="Christmas" id="Christmas"></a><ins title="Original has
'Chistmas'">Christmas</ins>
song, which accompanies the drill. Following the song they wind a spiral to
the center of the stage, unwind same and march off. Complete instructions
are given. It is the best Christmas drill ever published; easy to produce and
decidedly novel. Price, 15 cents.</p>

<p><strong>PEARL’S CHRISTMAS.</strong> Original, pleasing and interesting Christmas
dialogue with an excellent moral, for 3 boys and 4 girls. Price, 5 cents;
seven copies, 25 cents.</p>

<p><strong>SITTING UP FOR SANTA CLAUS.</strong> A humorous dialogue for 6 girls,
5 boys, and Santa Claus. If you expect to have a Christmas entertainment,
you surely want this. Single copy, 10 cents; or 10 copies, 60 cents.</p>

collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
